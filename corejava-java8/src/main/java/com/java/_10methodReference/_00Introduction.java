// Functional interface method can be mapped to our specified method by using :: operator. This is called method reference.

// Our specified method can be either static method or instance method.

// Functional interface method and our specified method should have same argument types, except this the remaining things like
// return type, method name, modifiers are not required to match.

// Functional interface can refer lambda expressions and can also refer method reference. Hence method reference is alternative to 
// lambda expressions.
