/* Underlying data structure is HashTable.
 * Insertion order is not preserved and it is based on hashCode of keys.
 * Duplicate keys are not allowed and values can be duplicated.
 * Heterogeneous objects are allowed for both keys and values.
 * Null is not allowed for both keys and values otherwise we will get NullPointerException.
 * It implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.
 * Every method present in hashTable is synchronized and hence hashTable object is thread safe.
 * HashTable is the best choice if our frequent operation is search operation.
