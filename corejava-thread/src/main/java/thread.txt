Executing several task simultaneously is the concept of multi-threading. There are 2 types of multi-tasking
a) Process Based b) Thread Based

Process Based : Executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate independent program(process)
known as Process Based Multitasking. It is best suitable at OS level.
For example, while typing a java program we can listen to audio and at the same we can download a file.

Thread Based  : Executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate independent part of same program 
known as Thread Based Multitasking and each independent part is called Thread.

Main objective of multi-tasking is to reduce response time of the system and improve performance.

Main important areas of multi-threading are web-servers, app-servers, video games and animations.

Java provides rich standard API's for multi-threading.
