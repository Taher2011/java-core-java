/*wait()
It tells the calling thread to give up the lock and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify(). */


/*notify()
It wakes up one single thread that called wait() on the same object. It should be noted that calling notify() does not actually give up a lock on a resource. It tells a waiting thread that that thread can wake up. However, the lock is not actually given up until the notifierâ€™s synchronized block has completed.

So, if a notifier calls notify() on a resource but the notifier still needs to perform 10 seconds of actions on the resource within its synchronized block, the thread that had been waiting will need to wait at least another additional 10 seconds for the notifier to release the lock on the object, even though notify() had been called.
