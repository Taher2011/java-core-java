Throw : Sometimes we create exception object explicitly and hand over to jvm manually for this we have to use throw.

		throw new ArithmeticException("/by 0);
		
		throw - > handing over our created exception object to jvm manually.
		new ArithmeticException("/by 0) - > creation of Arithmetic exception object explicitly.
		
		Main objective of throw is to handover created exception object to jvm.
		
		Best use of throw is for user defined exceptions or customized exceptions.
		

We can use throw only for throwable types.
